Written in Java using Netbeans and MySQL
A Hospital Management System Which I created for my 1st year project using java swings in netbeans with combination of MySQL Database.

* Uses MySQL in backend
* Provides Password protection
* Friendly Interface
* Records and Retrive data
# Startup Process
* First you will need to setup MySQL and then dump tables using the sql file which is provided
* This will compete the database setup
Then you need to download two jar files rs2xml.jar and My-SQL Connector given in the project and add it to your lib in netbeans project.
# Netbeans
* Then create a new java application project names 'MyHospital' and make sure it is empty(delete any package file in it).
* Then copy MyHospital folder from the given files and paste it in C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\NetBeansProjects and overwrite it and your done.
Thank you And have fun coding in the future :)
